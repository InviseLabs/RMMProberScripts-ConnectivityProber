## ConnectivityProber: Helps Monitor Network Latency, Ping MS, and Jitter
###### Part of our [RMMProberScripts](https://github.com/InviseLabs/RMMProberScripts) – A collection of deployable Windows-based command-line scripts designed to warn you of concerning hardware or sensor problems. Each tool outputs the associated raw troubleshooting values, along with a PASS or FAIL and proper exit codes. Use with RMM or IT Admin software to alert you when a script check FAILs. — Invise Labs is a division of, and sponsored by, [Invise Solutions - Computer and IT Solutions Utah](https://invisesolutions.com/) – We are IT professionals making tools and programs for use by other IT pros.

A small Windows-based command-line tool which sends 100 ping packets to Google or Yahoo and reports the percentage of dropped packets, avg ms, detected jitter, along with a PASS or FAIL status. Designed to be deployed with a RMM dashboard or IT Admin software.

Works with any RMM dashboard that supports monitoring command-line output and exit codes. Please read below to understand how this script works before you deploy.
